# Arithmetic operators are used to performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Examples of Arithmetic Operator
a = 9
b = 4

# Addition of numbers
add = a + b

# Subtraction of numbers
sub = a - b

# Multiplication of number
mul = a * b

# Division(float) of number
div1 = a / b

# Division(floor) of number (whole divident only)
div2 = a // b

# Modulo of both number(remainder of the divident only)
mod = a % b

# Power
p = a ** b

# print results
print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div1)
print(div2)
print(mod)
print(p)
