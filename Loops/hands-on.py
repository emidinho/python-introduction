### for-loop (used for sequences)

# name = "pytho workshop"

# for each_character in name:
#     print(each_character)


# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grapes", "mangoes", "lemons"]
# for fruit_types in fruits:
#     print(fruit_types)



# marks = [63,77, 23,97,98,85,95,80, 87,93]
# print("\n grading system ")

# for x in marks:
#     print(x)
#     if x >= 75 and x <= 80:
#         print("Passed: C")
#     elif x >= 81 and x <= 85:
#         print("Passed: B-")
#     elif x >= 86 and x <= 90:
#         print("Passed: B")
#     elif x >= 91 and x <= 94:
#         print("Passed: B+")
#     elif x >= 95 and x <= 97:
#         print("Passed: A")
#     elif x >= 98 and x <= 100:
#         print("Passed: A+")    
#     else:
#         print("Failed")

# buckets = ["invoice-bucket", "images-bucket", "documents-bucket", "movies-bucket"]

# for bucket in buckets:
#     print(bucket)

# for i in range(1,50,10):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(5):
#     print("enter pin")

# student = {"name": "emidio", "school": "GSN", "place": "fontem", "marital-status": "single", 
#            "employment-status": "unemployed"}
# for i,j in student.items():
#     print(i,j)

### for loop.


### while loop.(used for conditions)
# pin_count = 0

# while pin_count <= 5:
#     pin_entered = False
#     if pin_entered == False:
#         pin_count = pin_count + 1
#         if pin_count <= 5:
#             print("please enter your pin again")
#         else:
#             print("pin block, try after 1 hour")

# count = 1

# while count < 10:
#     print (count)
#     count = count + 1

### while loop.


### nested loops

student = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]
for i in student:
    print(i)
    for j in i:
        print(j)
